14. Please carry out a small statistical analysis around (1) Horsepower (2) Weight (3) Accel. Try calculating the mean, median and standard deviation. Use SQL queries to extract theve measures. What do these measures convey about horsepower and weight of the cars data? Share SQLs and few bullets on your understanding on the values captured for mean, median and standard deviation

select avg(horsepower), median (horsepower), stddev(horsepower),
avg(weight), median (weight), stddev(weight), 
avg(accel), median (accel), stddev(accel)
from car_details;

15. Draw the entity-relationship (ER) model depicting car database tables, PK and FK (uc., relationships between them) on a plain paper using pen/pencil. Share the screenshot (ensure picture is clearly visible) and share.
